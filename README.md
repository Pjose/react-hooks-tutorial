# React Hooks Tutorial
React Hooks - are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components. 
            - Hooks don't work inside classes.

## State Hooks
useState - let's you add a state variable to your component.
useReducer - declares a state variable with the update logic inside a reducer function.

## Effect Hook
useEffect - connects a component to an external system.

## Performance Hooks
useMemo - lets you cache the result of an expensive calculation.
useCallback - lets you cache a function definition before passing it down to an optimized component.
